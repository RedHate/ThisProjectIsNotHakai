# MPC 2.12.3 / FORCE 3.3.0

	Basically the same as "Hakai", except no longer requires any sort of card to switch modes.
	
	Hold TC and press pad bank A to spoof ADA2. (then start new project to init force mode)
	Hold TC and press pad bank B to enter ACVK mode (then start new project to init force keyboard mode) (if for some reason ADA2 mode isnt working right for you)
	Hold TC and press pad bank C to return to normal MPC mode.
	Hold TC and press pad bank D to completely disable the MIDI library so you can install a firmware update or return to stock
	
	Known issues:
		You must completely exit the midi library by holding TC and pressing pad bank D then starting a new project before you can install a new firmware.
